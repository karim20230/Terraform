Terraform Deployment to Azure

Prerequisites

    An active Azure Subscription.
    Installation of Terraform: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install

Setup

    Fork the repository.

    Create a file named terraform.tfvars in the root directory.

    Add the following credentials to the terraform.tfvars file. You can obtain these credentials from Azure CLI, Azure UI console, or by contacting Karim.

    hcl

    subscription_id = ""
    client_id       = ""
    client_secret   = ""
    tenant_id       = ""
    

Running the Example

    Initialize Terraform:
    terraform init

Plan the deployment (this shows you what will happen without actually performing the deployment):

terraform plan

Apply the deployment to Azure:

terraform apply

To tear down everything that the script deployed, run:

    terraform destroy
